Thank you for installing Copy, Cut, and Paste Lines.

This package attempts to improve your coding efficiency by making Copy, Cut, and Paste always operate on full lines of code. The only exception to this is a selection within a single line - in this case, copy and cut will behave as normal, affecting only the selected text.

The default shortcuts for Copy, Cut, Paste, and Duplicate lines have been rebound to the "improved" versions contained in this package.

If you need to use the original copy/cut/paste, use the Edit menu, or these key bindings:
	Original Copy:  Ctrl+Alt+C
	Original Cut:   Ctrl+Alt+X
	Original Paste: Ctrl+Alt+V

If you want to change any key bindings, paste the code below in "Key Bindings - User", and edit the keys to your liking.
	// Key bindings for the "improved" copy, cut, paste, and duplicate commands:
	{ "keys": ["ctrl+c"], "command": "ccpl_copy" },
	{ "keys": ["ctrl+x"], "command": "ccpl_cut" },
	{ "keys": ["ctrl+v"], "command": "ccpl_paste" },
	{ "keys": ["ctrl+shift+d"], "command": "ccpl_duplicate" },
	// Key bindings for the original copy, cut, paste, and duplicate commands:
	{ "keys": ["ctrl+alt+c"], "command": "copy" },
	{ "keys": ["ctrl+alt+x"], "command": "cut" },
	{ "keys": ["ctrl+alt+v"], "command": "paste" },
	{ "keys": [""], "command": "duplicate_lines" },
